            <h1>JPEG File Compression</h1>
            <p>
                This project is aimed at users who want to compress their JPEG files (file size &lt; 50Mb) to a specific size. After compression, we allow the users to either download the file from our server or get the files sent to their email address. This is a user-friendly web application in Python.
    We use FTP (File Transfer Protocol) for upload and download of the file and SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) for sending the file via email.

            <h2>User Guide</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Select a <strong>.jpg</strong> or <strong>.jpeg</strong> image to upload.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Click on the <strong>upload</strong> button.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The file will not get uploaded in the following cases:
                    <ul>
                        <li>If the file extension is not .jpg or jpeg</li>
                        <li>If the file size <strong>exceeds 50MB</strong></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    If file gets accepted, you will get redirected to a new page.
                </li>
                <li>
                    On successful compression (to less than 80% of original size), the user has two options:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            The download button downloads the compressed image for the user.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Send as email button sends the compressed image as an email attachment to a valid and existing email address specified by the user.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                
            </ol>
