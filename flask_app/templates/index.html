                    This project is aimed at users who want to compress their JPEG files (file size &lt; 50Mb) to a specific size. After compression, we allow the users to either download the file from our server or get the files sent to their email address. This is a user-friendly web application in Python.
        We use FTP (File Transfer Protocol) for upload and download of the file and SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) for sending the file via email.

                <div class="blue-box">
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Select a <strong>.jpg</strong> or <strong>.jpeg</strong> image to upload.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Click on the <strong>upload</strong> button.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The file will not get uploaded in the following cases:
                            <ul>
                                <li>If the file extension is not .jpg or jpeg</li>
                                <li>If the file size <strong>exceeds 50MB</strong></li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If file gets accepted, you will get redirected to a new page.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            On successful compression (to less than 80% of original size), the user has two options:
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    The download button downloads the compressed image for the user.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Send as email button sends the compressed image as an email attachment to a valid and existing email address specified by the user.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
        
                    </ol>
