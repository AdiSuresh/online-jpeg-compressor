# online-jpeg-compressor

This project is aimed at users who want to compress their JPEG files (file size &lt; 50Mb) to a specific size. After compression, we allow the users to either download the file from our server or get the files sent to their email address. This is a user-friendly web application in Python.

We use FTP (File Transfer Protocol) for upload and download of the file and SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) for sending the file via email.

FTP is a standard communication protocol used for the transfer of computer files from a server to a client on a computer network. FTP is built
on a clientâ€“server model architecture using separate control and data connections between the client and the server.
