# Online JPEG File Compression Tool

This project is aimed at users who want to compress their JPEG files (file size &lt; 50Mb) to a specific size. After compression, we allow the users to either download the file from our server or get the files sent to their email address. This is a user-friendly web application in Python.

We use FTP (File Transfer Protocol) for upload and download of the file and SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) for sending the file via email.

**FTP** is a standard communication protocol used for the transfer of computer files from a server to a client on a computer network. FTP is built on a clientâ€“server model architecture using separate control and data connections between the client and the server.

**SMTP** is a set of communication guidelines that allow software to transmit an electronic mail over the internet. This protocol allows applications to send and receive emails.
